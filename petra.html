  <h1>PETRA</h1>

  <div class="intro"> 
     <h2><U>Introduction</U></h2>
    
           <p>Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batraʾ; Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"), originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu , is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan.</p>
  
           <p><strong>   Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved; it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. </strong></p>
           <p> The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
           
           <p><strong>History</strong></p>
           <p>Neolithic
            By 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.</p>
           
           <p><strong>Bronze Age</strong></p>
           <p>Petra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir</p>
  </div> 
  <DIV class="his">
   <h2><u>Iron Age Edom</u></h2>
     
                <p><strong>Iron Age Edom</strong></p>
                <p>The Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. This came when the Edomites rebelled after the death of King Solomon in 928 BC when Israel split into two kingdoms for Israel to be in the north and Judah in the south.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Emergence of Petra</strong></p>
                <p>In AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital.[29] The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built </p>
                
                <p><strong>Roman period</strong></p>

It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built</p>
                
                <p><strong>Byzantine period</strong></p>
                <p>Petra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Crusaders and Mamluks</strong></p>
                <p>In the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.[</p>
                
               
                <p>hTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra.</p>

    <h2><u>19th and 20th centuries</u></h2>
    
                <p>The first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812. At that time, the Greek Church of Jerusalem operated a diocese in Al Karak named Battra (باطره in Arabic, and Πέτρας in Greek) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.</p>
  
                <p><strong>21st century</strong></p>
                <p>Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. </p>
    
                 <p><strong>Layout</strong></p>
                  <p>In ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun ("Aaron's Mountain"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses.</p>
    
                     <p><strong>Hellenistic architecture</strong></p>
    <p>Petra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures which the Nabataens traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone </p>
    
    <p><strong>City centre</strong></p>
    <p>At the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh ("the Treasury"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Myths</strong></p>
    <p>Ever since its construction, the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography, and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument.</p>
